    <h2> About me</h2>
    <div class="box1">
      <h4>School</h4>
        <p>I am currently a junior at the American School of Correspondance. It's a distance school, so everything I do for it is at home, on my computer. Because of that, lot of the time I will call myself homeschooled, even though the school is recognized at a private school.</p>
      <h4>Family</h4>
        <p>I have an older sister, an older brother, and a younger brother. My older brother is about to start college, and my younger brother is 14 now. My sister doesn't live with us anymore, but she has a baby daughter that I get to watch occasionally.</p>
      <h4>Other things</h4>
        <p>I have 8 pets, and half of them are cats. I like cats.</p>
        <p>I don't exactly have hobbies, the only things I do in my freetime is scroll through instagram and watch youtube.</p>
        <p>The only thing I know about where my family is from is that I have one great grandparent who came here from Austria, which makes me like 12% Austrian.</p>
